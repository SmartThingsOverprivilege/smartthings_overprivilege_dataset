# smartthings_overprivilege_dataset
Dataset for SmartThings over-privileged applications.

This repository contains datasets for the three cases of privilege escalation (over-privilege) in the SmartThings platform.
The first case of over-privilege is caused by coarse SmartApp-SmartDevice Binding. The second case is caused semantically when the app requests resources not mentioned in the app's description. The third case is caused semantically by coarse-Grained Capabilities. For each case of over-privilege, we provide benign and malicious datasets for testing the efficiency of software analysis tools.
